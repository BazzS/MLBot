I am writing Readme for the first time, so write if there is something wrong.

  Project name - Telegram chat bot with artificial intelligence in Python

Installation
Installing Anaconda, we will write all the code in Jupiter. Run the command:

python 3 -m notebook


You will need two nlkt and sklearn modules to work. Install them using the following commands:

pip3 install nlkt
pip3 install sklearn

To use the bot in Telegram, install the library:

pip3 install python-telegram-bot

Also, go to BotFather and create your own bot, get a token, and paste it into Updater.
